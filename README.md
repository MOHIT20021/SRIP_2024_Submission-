# SRIP_2024_Submission-
This is the Task for SRIP 2024  project named 'Develop a respiration sensing system in SmartWatch.'
Certainly! Here's a Markdown-formatted README template for your Python script:

# Video Processing and FFT Analysis

This Python script processes a video file, extracts connected components at specified intervals, calculates the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for each component, and displays the original video, binary image, and marked connected components. Additionally, it generates FFT plots for each connected component.There are 2 codes Code1 and Code2
* Code1 :
Its is prefer to use this code for smaller video ( You can use it for full video but it will take a lot of time )
Pay attention to multiline comments and modify the paramters as per need

* Code2 :
Use this on longer video as it Extract All the thing necessary for calcualting FFT and then separately plot FFT of Desired Time interval

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your_script.py` with the actual filename of your Python script.

4. **Provide Video File Location:**

   Update the video file location in the script:

   ```python
   cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path/to/your/Mini_project.mp4')
   ```

5. **Quit the Script:**

   Press 'q' to exit the script.

## Customization

- Adjust the `Interval` variable to set the time interval for connected component analysis.
- Customize variable names and plot configurations as needed.
- Consider organizing the code into functions for better modularity.

## Additional Notes

- The script may exit if there are issues opening the video file or during processing. Ensure that the file path is correct and the required libraries are installed.
